# Functional-Programming-Exercises
This is a repository of my personal exercises for Functional Programming as well as other JS practice files.
I am currently on the journey of becoming a better programmer (and not a noob) and figured it was time to explore functional programming.
The collection of exercise will be based on FP learning materials including:

- Kyle Simpson's functional light book
- Brian Lonsdorf's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming.
- Eric Elliot's Programming JavaScript Applications.
- etc...

I encourage anyone to fork this repo and learn along with me or make changes of your own. I am a fairly new programmer so some exercises will be "kind of" practical. 

## Usage

All files are completely JS so, I would prefer that you had Node (latest version), that way all example code can be run on Node. However, no NPMs or Node is necessary (node_modules and Ramda.js have been recently installed). The majority of the code should be able to run in the browser playgrounds such as Codepen, JSFiddle etc....

- All files are organized by the Functional Programming resources root folder and the chapters associated.
- Carefully review code in files in order to see a working example. Some return statements must be changed to console.log's
- I will try my best to leave a /* NOTE */ which should give instructions on how to test parts of the code.
- To run on Node: node [ name of resource ] / [ chp#.js ] The # in chp means the chapter number.
- If you do not have Node copy the code and paste it into your favorite JS playground online. 
- Or however, you wish to run the JS files are completely up to you.
